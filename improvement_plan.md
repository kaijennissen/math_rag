# Improvement Plan for Math RAG Codebase

This document outlines a plan to improve the maintainability of the Math RAG codebase while minimizing disruptive changes to the existing architecture.

## 1. Module Structure Improvements

- âœ… Rename `agent_system` to `rag_agents` (already implemented)
- Create a unified config module to centralize configuration management
- Add proper type hints throughout the codebase
- Consolidate duplicated code in knowledge graph and embedding modules

## 2. Documentation Enhancements

- Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods/classes
- Create a high-level architecture document explaining component interactions
- Document the data flow from document processing to query answering
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms

## 3. Error Handling & Logging

- Implement consistent error handling patterns across modules
- Create custom exceptions for specific error cases
- Enhance logging with more context for debugging
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms

## 4. Testing Strategy

- Create unit tests for core components
- Add integration tests for Neo4j graph operations
- Implement test fixtures for common scenarios
- Add tests for edge cases in document processing

## 5. Configuration Management

- Move hardcoded values to configuration files
- Create a configuration validation system
- Support multiple environment configurations
- Implement sensible defaults with clear documentation

## 6. Dependency Management

- Implement dependency injection for better testability
- Create clear interfaces between components
- Review and minimize external dependencies
- Use a modern dependency manager like Poetry

## 7. Code Quality Improvements

- Add linting with ruff (already in CLAUDE.md)
- Implement consistent code style across modules
- Add pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Refactor long methods into smaller, focused functions

## 8. Performance Optimizations

- Add caching for expensive graph operations
- Optimize Cypher queries
- Implement batch processing for document ingestion
- Add monitoring for performance bottlenecks

## 9. User Experience

- Improve CLI interface with better error messages
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- Create example notebooks for common use cases
- Implement session management for chat history

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with documentation and testing improvements
2. Implement configuration management changes
3. Refactor core modules with better error handling
4. Add performance optimizations
5. Enhance user experience components

This approach focuses on improving maintainability while preserving the existing architecture and functionality.
